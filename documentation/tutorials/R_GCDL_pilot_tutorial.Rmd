## Overview

This tutorial covers the SCINet Geospatial Common Data Library (GeoCDL), a community project from the [Geospatial Working Group](https://scinet.usda.gov/working-groups/geospatial) to reduce the time and effort to access commonly used spatial datasets. 

![GeoCDL basic architecture. This tutorial covers how to access the central Web API with R. ](../basic_architecture.png){width=100%}

This example covers the pilot features implemented in the GeoCDL web API v0.1.0. The tutorial assumes you are either on CERES or a local machine connected to the [SCINet VPN](https://scinet.usda.gov/guide/vpn). For more details on the development of the web API, see [https://github.com/USDA-SCINet/geocdl/](https://github.com/USDA-SCINet/geocdl/) (request access from brian.stucky@usda.gov).

To learn more about the `R` package `rgcdl` in development to streamline these requests, see [https://github.com/USDA-SCINet/rgcdl/](https://github.com/USDA-SCINet/rgcdl/)

## Data Details

* Data: MODIS NDVI Data, Smoothed and Gap-filled, for the Conterminous US: 2000-2015
* Link: [https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1299](https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1299)
* Other Details: This dataset is acquired via the GeoCDL. It is 70.8 GB, but the GeoCDL leverages data access protocols to access the dataset remotely from online servers, use server-side functions for basic spatial and temporal filtering, and download the user's requested subset of data.

## Tutorial Steps

* Specify desired data - Define the spatiotemporal scope of the user request:
  * Dataset and variables
  * Temporal coverage 
  * Spatial coverage, spatial resolution, and CRS
* Build GeoCDL query - desc….
* Download requested data - desc….
* Visualize results - desc...

## Step 0: Import Libraries/Packages

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(raster)
library(sf)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
```

## Step 1: Point to Web API

The GeoCDL Web API lives on a CERES service node that can be accessed by ... It has multiple endpoints, each of which will be showcased below. 

```{r step1}
# Web API address
gcdl_url <- 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/'

# Subset polygon endpoint: for requesting gridded data within an area
polygon_ep <- 'subset_polygon/'

# Point subset endpoint: for requesting point data
point_ep <- 'subset_point/'

```


## Step 2: Specify area and date range of interest 

We will focus on the USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range in southern New Mexico. We will showcase returning both gridded data overlapping the site and point data at experiment locations within it. To specify these areas, we will read in a shapefile of the site boundary and a shapefile of experiment locations. These shapefiles are in UTM 13N CRS. The package `sf` is used to read in the shapefiles and extract the necessary information for GeoCDL. 

First, we will retrieve the bounding box around the site with the function `st_bbox`. Currently, GeoCDL v0.1.0 only supports bounding boxes for areas of interest [not true anymore! show both? at leasst text general polygon]. The expected format is `xmin,ymax,xmax,ymin` [still true?], so we will rearrange `st_bbox`'s returned value into that order and collapse the vector into a string.

Next, we will extract the CRS information so we can tell GeoCDL the CRS of our area of interest. GeoCDL v0.1.0 only accepts EPSG codes [not true anymore!]. The output of `st_crs` contains this information. 

For this example, we will request all data from 2000-2010. Since this data is monthly, we will format it in GeoCDL's expected monthly format of 'YYYY-MM'.  

```{r step2}
# Read in Jornada boundary shapefile and format bounding box for GeoCDL
jer_bounds <- st_read('assets/R_GCDL_pilot_tutorial/Boundary.shp')  
jer_bbox <- st_bbox(jer_bounds) # returns c(xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax)
bbox_str <- paste(jer_bbox[c(1,4,3,2)], collapse = ',')

# View CRS info
st_crs(jer_bounds)
# Extract EPSG code 
jer_crs <- st_crs(jer_bounds)$input


# Date range
start_month = '2019-06'  ## testing locally
end_month = '2019-08'    ## testing locally


```

## Step 3: Select datasets and their variables

The GeoCDL can be queried to return the currently available datasets and their metadata. We will be using the MODIS NDVI Data, Smoothed and Gap-filled, for the Conterminous US: 2000-2015 data product which is stored under the ID *MODIS_NDVI*.
We can see from its metadata that this dataset has a ... CRS, different from our area of interest objects. The GeoCDL will accommodate the discrepancy. The metadata also indicates that there is just one variable: NDVI. We will format the dataset and variable list in the expected format of `DATASET_ID:VARNAME[,VARNAME...]`.

```{r step3}
# 1, Query the GeoCDL to list all datasets
all_datasets <- fromJSON(url(paste0(gcdl_url,'list_datasets')))
all_datasets
my_ds <- 'PRISM' # not really, MODIS_NDVI product once it's supported

# 2. View a dataset's metadata
fromJSON(url(paste0(gcdl_url,'ds_info?id=',my_ds)))
my_vars <- c('ppt') # to be NDVI

# 3. Format dataset and variable
dv_str <- paste0(my_ds,':',paste(my_vars,collapse = ','))

```

## Step 4: Build and submit request to GeoCDL

Now that we've defined and formatted the pieces of the request, we can merge them into a request URL to communicate with the GeoCDL. The `download.file` function accepts this kind of URL and downloads the returned file to the specified path. GeoCDL returns a zipped folder of the requested data plus a metadata file. 

```{r step4}
#  Prepare query
q_str <- paste0(gcdl_url,
                'subset?',
                paste0(
                  'date_start=',start_month,
                  '&date_end=',end_month,
                  '&crs=',jer_crs,
                  '&datasets=',URLencode(dv_str, reserved = TRUE),
                  '&bbox=',URLencode(bbox_str, reserved = TRUE)))  

outpath <- 'assets/tmp'

download.file(q_str, paste0(outpath,'.zip'))
unzip('assets/tmp.zip')

list.files(paste0(outpath,'.zip'))




```

## Step 5: Read in and visualize results from GeoCDL

```{r step5, out.width="100%"}
# Create a raster stack of returned GeoTIFFs
prism_2019 <- list.files('assets/tmp','.tif',full.names = TRUE) %>%
  stack() 

prism_2019 %>%
  as.data.frame(xy = TRUE) %>%
  pivot_longer(contains('PRISM'),
               names_to = c(NA,'var','year','month'),
               names_sep = c('[_.]')) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_tile(aes(x,y,fill=value)) +
  geom_sf(fill = NA,
          data=jer_bounds) +
  facet_grid(var~month) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Blues", direction = 1) +
  theme_few(base_size = 8)
```
